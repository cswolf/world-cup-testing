The initial structure of this app and tests borrow HEAVILY from https://github.com/rajzshkr/todoapi

Inspiration comes from my friends command line world cup dashboard https://github.com/cedricblondeau/world-cup-2018-cli-dashboard


`npm install` to install the requirements

`npm test` to run the tests
